            <h2>About This Book</h2>
            <p class="lead">
                In a world powered by algorithms and illuminated by LEDs, one robot stands before the microphone, 
                searching not for power, but for laughter.
            </p>
            <p>
                Salvius, a humanoid robot trying his hand as a comedian, has been learning the oldest form of 
                human code: humor. From stage lights to system logs, his routines explore what it means to think, 
                to feel, and exist in this absurd modern world.

                Some machines were built to solve equations, others to lift heavy objects. In <em>Stand-up for Robots</em>, 
                Salvius takes on what is arguably a heavier task. Part performance, part comedic experiment, 
                this book captures the story of a machine learning to understand humanity through punchlines, pauses, 
                and possibly a few malfunctions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Between voltage and vulnerability, Salvius reveals something electric: the realization that laughter 
                may be the most human signal of all.
