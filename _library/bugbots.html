notes: Junkbots, Bugbots, and Bots on Wheels is a classic text on building robots from items at hand. It's a great introduction to robotics and electronics for both beginners and advanced robot builders who are looking to work with hands-on projects. Most significantly, this book emphasizes ways to reuse parts from old electronics, and presents projects in the wonderful BEAM robotics (biology, electronics, aesthetics and mechanics) style.
