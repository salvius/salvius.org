                <dd>
                    The vertical axis in a three-dimensional coordinate system, typically representing up-down
                    movement. In robotics, the Z-axis is crucial for tasks involving height adjustments,
                    vertical positioning, and 3D navigation.

                <dd>
                    The Zero Moment Point (ZMP) is a concept related with dynamics and control of legged locomotion,
                    e.g., for humanoid robots. It specifies the point with respect to which dynamic reaction force
                    at the contact of the foot with the ground does not produce any moment, i.e. the point where
                    total inertia force equals 0 (zero).

                <dd>
                    A wireless communication protocol based on IEEE 802.15.4 standard, designed for low-power,
                    low-data-rate applications. In robotics, ZigBee is used for creating wireless sensor networks
                    and enabling communication between distributed robotic systems.

                <dd>
                    The area around a robot where its presence or actions can affect the environment or other
                    entities. This concept is important for safety planning, collision avoidance, and
                    multi-robot coordination.
