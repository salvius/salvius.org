                <dd>
                    A multi-master, multi-slave, packet switched, single-ended, <a href="https://blog.salvius.org/2012/02/using-grove-l298-dual-h-bridge-i2c.html">serial computer bus</a> invented by Philips Semiconductor (now NXP Semiconductors) in 1982. It is typically used for attaching lower-speed peripheral ICs to processors and microcontrollers in short-distance, intra-board communication.

                <dd>
                    The interconnection via the Internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data.

                <dd>
                    The mathematical process of calculating the variable joint parameters needed to place the end of a kinematic chain, such as a robotic arm or leg, in a desired position and orientation.

                <dd>
                    A unique number consisting of four numbers, called octets, separated by periods (also called a 'dotted-quad'). Each octet can contain any value between 0 and 255 resulting in a possible 4,294,967,296 unique values. Out of the almost 4.3 billion possible combinations, certain values are restricted from use as typical IP addresses. For example, the IP address 0.0.0.0 is reserved for the default network and the address 255.255.255.255 is used for broadcasts. IP addresses are usually assigned to internet service providers within region-based blocks so an IP address can often be used to identify the region or country from which a computer is connecting to the Internet, possibly showing the user's general location.
