                <dt id="machine-learning"><b><a href="#machine-learning">Machine Learning</a></b></dt>
                <dd>
                    A subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience
                    without being explicitly programmed. In robotics, machine learning is used for perception,
                    navigation, manipulation, and decision-making tasks.

                <dt id="machine-vision"><b><a href="#machine-vision">Machine Vision</a></b></dt>
                <dd>
                    The technology that enables robots to "see" and interpret visual information from cameras and
                    other imaging devices. Machine vision systems can identify objects, read text, measure dimensions,
                    and guide robotic movements based on visual input.

                <dt id="manipulator"><b><a href="#manipulator">Manipulator</a></b></dt>
                <dd>
                    Or gripper. A robotic 'hand' or arm designed to grasp, move, and manipulate objects.
                    Manipulators can have various configurations and degrees of freedom depending on their
                    intended application.

                <dt id="microcontroller"><b><a href="#microcontroller">Microcontroller</a></b></dt>
                <dd>
                    A compact integrated circuit designed to control specific operations in embedded systems.
                    In robotics, microcontrollers serve as the "brain" of robots, processing sensor inputs
                    and controlling actuators. Popular examples include Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
                </dd>

                <dt id="mobile-robot"><b><a href="#mobile-robot">Mobile Robot</a></b></dt>
                <dd>
                    A self-propelled and self-contained robot that is capable of moving over a mechanically
                    unconstrained course. Mobile robots can navigate autonomously and are used in applications
                    ranging from household cleaning to space exploration.
                </dd>

                <dt id="motor-controller"><b><a href="#motor-controller">Motor Controller</a></b></dt>
                <dd>
                    An electronic device that regulates the operation of electric motors. In robotics, motor
                    controllers manage speed, direction, and torque of motors based on commands from the
                    robot's control system.
                </dd>

                <dt id="muting"><b><a href="#muting">Muting</a></b></dt>
                <dd>
                    The deactivation of a presence-sensing safeguarding device during a portion of the robot cycle.
                    This safety feature allows robots to operate in certain areas while maintaining overall
                    safety protocols.
