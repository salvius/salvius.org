                <dd>
                    A type of drone with four rotors positioned in a square formation.<a href="https://blog.salvius.org/2013/09/building-quadrocam.html">Quadcopters</a> are widely used
                    in robotics applications for aerial surveillance, mapping, delivery, and research due to their
                    stability and maneuverability.

                <dt id="quadruped"><b><a href="#quadruped">Quadruped</a></b></dt>
                <dd>
                    A robot that moves on four legs, similar to animals like dogs, cats, or horses. Quadruped robots
                    are designed for stability and mobility over various terrains, often used in military, rescue,
                    and exploration applications.

                <dd>
                    The systematic process of ensuring that robotic systems meet specified requirements and standards.
                    In robotics manufacturing, QA involves testing components, software, and complete systems to
                    verify performance, safety, and reliability.

                <dd>
                    A computer that makes use of the quantum states of subatomic particles to store information.
                    Quantum computers have potential applications in robotics for complex optimization problems
                    and machine learning algorithms.

                <dd>
                    A data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. In robotics programming,
                    queues are used for task scheduling, command processing, and managing sequences of operations
                    that need to be executed in order.
