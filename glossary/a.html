                <dt id="actuator"><b><a href="#actuator">Actuator</a></b></dt>
                <dd>
                    A component of a machine that is responsible for moving or controlling a mechanism or system.
                    It takes energy, usually provided by air, electricity, or liquid, and converts it into motion.
                    Examples of actuators include electric motors, hydraulic cylinders, and pneumatic cylinders.

                <dt id="aerobot"><b><a href="#aerobot">Aerobot</a></b></dt>
                <dd>
                    A type of robot designed to operate in the atmosphere of a planet or other celestial body.
                    Aerobots are often used for exploration and scientific research, and they can be equipped with
                    various sensors and instruments to collect data.

                <dt id="algorithm"><b><a href="#algorithm">Algorithm</a></b></dt>
                <dd>
                    A set of rules or instructions designed to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem.
                    Algorithms are used in computer programming to manipulate data and perform calculations.
                    They can be simple, like sorting a list of numbers, or complex, like those used in machine learning.
                </dd>

                <dt id="adc"><b><a href="#adc">ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)</a></b></dt>
                <dd>
                    A device that converts an analog signal (continuous signal) into a digital signal (discrete values).
                    ADCs are commonly used in microcontrollers and other digital systems to read sensor data,
                    such as temperature, light intensity, or sound levels.
                </dd>

                <dt id="analog-signal"><b><a href="#analog-signal">Analog Signal</a></b></dt>
                <dd>
                    A continuous signal that represents physical measurements. Unlike digital signals,
                    which have discrete values (0s and 1s), analog signals can take on any value within a range.
                    Examples include sound waves, light intensity, and temperature readings.

                <dt id="android"><b><a href="#android">Android</a></b></dt>
                <dd>
                    A humanoid robot designed to resemble a human in appearance and behavior.
                </dd>

                <dt id="arduino"><b><a href="#arduino">Arduino</a></b></dt>
                <dd>
                    An open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.
                    Arduino boards are microcontrollers that can be programmed to read inputs (like light on a sensor)
                    and turn them into outputs (like activating a motor). They are widely used for prototyping
                    and building electronic projects.
                </dd>

                <dt id="artificial-intelligence"><b><a href="#artificial-intelligence">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</a></b></dt>
                <dd>
                    The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.
                    AI involves the development of algorithms that allow computers to perform tasks that typically
                    require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making,
                    and language translation.
                </dd>

                <dt id="assembly-language"><b><a href="#assembly-language">Assembly Language</a></b></dt>
                <dd>
                    A low-level programming language that is closely related to machine code. It uses symbolic
                    representations of binary instructions, making it easier for humans to read and write.
                    Assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture and is often used for
                    performance-critical applications or hardware manipulation.
                </dd>

                <dt id="automaton"><b><a href="#automaton">Automaton</a></b></dt>
                <dd>
                    A self-operating machine or control mechanism designed to follow a predetermined sequence of operations or respond to predetermined instructions.
                    Often used to refer to an <a href="https://blog.salvius.org/2014/01/a-history-of-robotics-yan-shi-artificer.html">early self-operating robot</a>, performing exactly the same actions, over and over.
