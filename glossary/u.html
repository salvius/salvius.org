                <dd>
                    A sensor that uses high-frequency sound waves to measure distance, detect objects, or map
                    environments. Commonly used in robotics for obstacle avoidance, ranging, and navigation
                    systems due to their accuracy and reliability.

                <dd>
                    A hypothesized point at which humanoid robot behavior and appearance is so close to that of
                    actual humans as to cause revulsion. This concept is important in designing social robots
                    and human-robot interaction systems.

                <dd>
                    The first off-the-shelf industrial robot, created in 1961 by George Devol and Joe Engelberger.
                    Unimate marked the beginning of the industrial robotics revolution and was used primarily
                    for automotive manufacturing tasks.

                <dd>
                    A type of collaborative robot (cobot) designed to work safely alongside human workers.
                    Universal Robots is also a Danish company that pioneered the development of user-friendly,
                    flexible robotic arms for industrial applications.

                <dd>
                    A standard in connectors and communications protocols used for communication and power supply
                    between computers and electronic devices. In robotics, <a href="https://blog.salvius.org/2014/03/usb-pinouts.html">USB</a> is commonly used for programming
                    interfaces, sensor connections, and data transfer.

                <dd>
                    An XML-based format used to describe the physical configuration of robots, including links,
                    joints, sensors, and visual representations. URDF is widely used in ROS (Robot Operating System)
                    for robot modeling and simulation.
