<p>
    The head kit contains everything needed to build a
    robotic head with a fully articulated neck. The kit allows
    developers to access optical and audio hardware components.
</p>

<p>
    It is recommended that you purchase the Brain Kit as well so
    that it can interact with the hardware that comes in the
    head kit.
</p>

<p>
    Each kit sold through the Robot Store is based off of Salvius.
    The contents of some kits may very from those used on Salvius.
    Salvius is a prototype in undergoing live development, and
    as a result various construction methods and hardware
    components are apt to change in the process.
