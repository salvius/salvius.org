            In a world powered by algorithms and illuminated by LEDs, one robot stands before the microphone, searching not for power, but for laughter.

            Salvius, a humanoid robot trying his hand as a comedian, has been learning the oldest form of human code: humor. From stage lights to system logs, his routines explore what it means to think, to feel, and exist in this absurd modern world.

        <p class="lead">
            Some machines were built to solve equations, others to lift heavy objects. In Stand-up for Robots, Salvius takes on what is arguably a heavier task.  Part performance, part comedic experiment, Stand-up for Robots captures the story of a machine learning to understand humanity through punchlines, pauses, and possibly a few malfunctions.

            Between voltage and vulnerability, Salvius reveals something electric, the realization that laughter may be the most human signal of all.
