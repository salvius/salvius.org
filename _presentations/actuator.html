            <h4>Project description</h4>

            <p>
                This project demonstrates how to reconfigure old drilldriver
                motors into high-power linear actuators. Linear actuators are
                valuable electromotive mechanisms in the field of robotics.

            <p>
                I used an a x b x c block of aluminum. A hole was drilled through the center,
                and then tapped with a x/y inch tap to match the x/y threaded rod.
