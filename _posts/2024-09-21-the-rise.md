Stories let us engage, understand, and think about information with context and structure that is significantly different from other forms of presentation. To explore this, in 2025 I'm going to be getting back into making YouTube videos, and create a handful of them that focus on creating a story around Salvius. I'm kicking off this process with the following YouTube Short:
