In the [last update](/updates/2024/09/the-rise/) I posted, I mentioned that alongside the process of revisiting designs for Salvius, I also wanted to incorporate some form of story telling. An important aspect of any compelling story is the voice of the narrative. And so today I released a Python package called `primitive-tts` with a few objects including:

1. Creating a distinctive voice for Salvius
2. Highlighting some of the downsides of a number of existing text-to-speech libraries
