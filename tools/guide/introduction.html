            This guide is meant to provide guidance in the construction of
            a humanoid robot using parts that are readily available. You may
            choose to build your robot differently than what the recommendations
            in this guide provide. Many parts of this guide are designed to be
            flexible in order to allow parts to be built using whatever is at hand. Note that each chapter has been designed so that the construction process can be expedited by building parts of the robot in parallel. This makes teamwork a lucrative benefactor in the construction process.
